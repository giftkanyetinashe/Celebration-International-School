    <h1>Our History</h1>

  <p>Celebration International School was founded by Pastors Tom and Bonnie Deuschle as a solution to an educational system which removed God from education. It was launched in January 2002 at Celebration Centre as Tree of Life Learning Centre under the Accelerated Christian Education (ACE) School. It began as one classroom with approximately 12 students ranging in age from 7 years to 14 years of age. Tree of Life Centre became known as Celebration Learning Centre.</p>

  <p>In June 2007, Celebration Learning Centre became a stand-alone entity inaugurating its own Board of Governors to govern its operations and develop the school further. Nonetheless, the CLC Board is still ultimately responsible to the church and the trust governing the church, which is Celebration Ministries International.</p>

  <p>At this time, the Celebration Learning Centre Board adopted the decision to transition from the homeschooling ACE curriculum which CLC had been using for the previous five years to a teacher-based Christian curriculum, the A Beka Curriculum. The A Beka curriculum is a biblically-based curriculum of a high academic standard. The core subjects are English, Mathematics, Science, Social Studies, and Bible. Art, Music, Physical Education, Life Skills, Spanish and Shona are also taught.</p>

  <p>In 2015, the High School English department adopted the Bob Jones University English curriculum after being introduced to this curriculum at the annual ICAA International Conference.</p>

  
  <p>Celebration International School is accredited by the International Christian Accreditation Association (ICAA), under the auspices of Oral Roberts University Educational Fellowship (ORUEF) and Zimbabwe Ministry of Primary and Secondary Education.</p>
