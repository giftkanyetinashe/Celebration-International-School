        <h3>K3 to Grade 6.</h3> 
        <p>Celebration International School (CIS) provides a learning culture that facilitates development of learners’ attitudes, beliefs and skills needed for success. Leaners are challenged with tasks that involve developing effective communication skills: oral, written, and digital.
          We prepare students to be life-long learners with strong character using the Bob Jones University (BJU) curriculum.</p>

        <h3>The Bob Jones Curriculum</h3><p>Is a curriculum built around the Christian worldview. Its core values are based on biblical teachings. The curriculum is based on providing children with reading materials that enable critical thinking and practical learning. It has courses for children in K3 up to the 12th-grade level. Subjects offered are Math, English, Science, Heritage Studies, Reading, Spelling, Shona, Music, Physical Education and Bible.</p>
        <p>Bob Jones Curriculum has brought technology into classrooms which has had a positive impact on the quality of education delivered. The students use eBooks which ensure that learners are proactively interacting with the learning material by way of videos, animations, augmented reality, changing displays, and taking notes.</p>
        <p>We believe education should be shaped according to the lens of Scripture. A complete education goes beyond facts and processes, so our textbooks and eBooks direct students to think for themselves. We teach learners to live life with a Godly purpose and thus set and pursue goals that thrust them towards their God-given purpose.</p>

      <h1>Sports Infant and Elementary</h1>
      <p>Every athlete exercises self-control in all things. They do it to receive a perishable wreath, but we an imperishable. (1 Corinthians 9:25)</p>
      <p>Celebration International School prepares children for good sportsmanship and fair play on and off the sports field. We conduct physical education classes, skills coaching, and team building in many sports. Every child from K5 to Grade 6 is taught to swim, with water safety being paramount.</p>
  
      <h4>The core sports offered include:</h4>
      <p>
        <i class="fas fa-running"></i> Athletics,
        <i class="fas fa-hiking"></i> Cross-Country,
        <i class="fas fa-futbol"></i> Soccer,
        <i class="fas fa-volleyball-ball"></i> Netball,

      </p>
      

  
      <p>On any day, the playing fields are abuzz with children eagerly involved in practicing or inter-school matches in one of their scheduled afternoon sports sessions.</p>
      <p>Our aim is to encourage participation in all sports by all our children. It is our belief that involvement outside the classroom is very important in the overall development of individuals and facilitates the growth of an improved sense of self in each participant. We also recognize that sport plays an important role in the development of both physique and character.</p>
