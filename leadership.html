            <h4>Mrs Munyaradzi,s Bio – Principal High school</h4>
            <p>In my 23 years of teaching, God has made it clear to me  that education is a media to one's destiny. It is through education, formal and informal, that the children that are entrusted to us answer the critical life questions, Who am ? and  Why am I here?. Celebration International School not only answers to academic excellence but also shapes the learners' call to serve as they discover what God called them to do. I am privileged to be a member of the team that transforms lives and reforms nations.</p>
